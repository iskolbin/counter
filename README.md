# counter

The most enterprise (complicated and bloated) web counter implementation!
The whole state of the application (single number) stored in the `Immutable` collection.
Data flow is handled by incredible means of the `Redux` technologies. `React` is used
to efficiently render ground breaking virtual dom! Keep your eyes of magnificent
visuals offered by `Bootstrap` framework! Oh, and this holy grail is written in 
super reliable `Typescript`. Before delivery it's carefully packed by `Webpack` and 
minified by `Uglify`.

P.S. Also you can use Redux-DevTools Extension to see data flow
